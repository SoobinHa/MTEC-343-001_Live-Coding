**Theme: Melancholic Forest**

* Estuary
* MiniTidal

My solo performance is about the forest, which has combination aspects of organic and digital sound. In the process of building this performance, I imagined myself in the middle of the empty forest. For that reason, *Melancholic Forest* has meditative flow. Although there are few simple sound samples, It creates full melancholic harmony. 

For the fist step of building the solo performance, I collected sound samples. And by experimenting, found the chords progrssion and combination of sounds that I pictured in my mind. 

My issue was there were too many sounds that I want to use in my piece. 
Since there is no limitation in combination of sounds, I got lost without core theme in the end. Trying to avoid this hazard, I ended up picking few sound samples that convey my theme and decided to improvise as the performance goes.
